3. Alternative text was added to images. Since the images in this website are decorative images, I inserted null alternative text tags after referring to [Web Accessibility Tutorials website] (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/)
4. In the main content, some elements such as online reputation management section and social media marketing section, had both a class and id. I used classes only. I also removed the additional classes in HTML (float-left and right for these images and used search engine optimization img class instead (in CSS).

**In CSS**
1. I grouped together the CSS classes which have the same properties. 
2. seo, which is a part of the company's name, is a unique element on its own. I deleted the header h1 part that came before the word seo and defined seo as an id in CSS and HTML. 
3.
